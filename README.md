# A react-random-color-generator

This application will show a random color when a button is clicked:

- [ ] A button with the exact text `Generate` will cause a new color to be generated when it is clicked
- [ ] Once a color is generated, update the background color of a div which contains the exact text `Generated Color: <background color hex code>` (the background color and the hex code must match)

- This time, you will need to think about design in the browser: Design the web app with a tool like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) or by sketching the design out on paper
- Come up with a detailed list of features you'll need for the application above

- For each of the features, write which dependencies, functions and React component(s) you'll need for them, if any
- Describe how each component will interact with the other components
- Identify any unknowns

## Stretch Goals

- Ask for a hue
- Ask for a lightness
- Transition smoothly between the colors as they change
- Use a CSS-in-JS library for all styling (eg. Emotion or Styled Components)
- Ask for a size for the color box and generate a box of that size
- Make a "screensaver mode" where the color box moves around in a diagonal pattern, bouncing off the screen edges and changing color (eg. like [this](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1935696/93082456-42d27100-f691-11ea-872a-7cb7c0df6b9a.gif))
