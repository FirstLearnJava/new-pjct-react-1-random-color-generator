# A react-random-color-generator

This application will show a random color when a button is clicked:

- [x] A button with the exact text `Generate` will cause a new color to be generated when it is clicked
- [x] Once a color is generated, the background color of the div updates, which contains the exact text `Generated Color: <background color hex code>` (the background color and the hex code must match)

## Stretch Goals

- [x] Option to select the boxes hue
- [x] Option to select the boxes lightness
- [x] Transition smoothly between the colors as they change
- [x] Styling by a CSS-in-JS library for all styling (eg. Emotion or Styled Components)
- [x] Option to generate a box of a size given by the user
- [x] A "screensaver mode" where the color box moves around in a diagonal pattern, bouncing off the screen edges and changing color (eg. like [this](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1935696/93082456-42d27100-f691-11ea-872a-7cb7c0df6b9a.gif))
